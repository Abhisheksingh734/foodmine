Certainly, let's tailor the README to focus solely on the project itself:

# Project Title

This project is a comprehensive web application built using Angular for the frontend and Express.js with MongoDB for the backend. It encompasses various functionalities including user authentication, cart management, order processing, and payment integration.

## Overview

The project aims to provide a seamless online food ordering experience for users. It allows users to browse a variety of food items, add them to their cart, place orders, and track their order status. Integration with PayPal provides secure payment options for users.

   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to Frontend Directory:**

   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start Frontend Development Server:**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.

### Backend Setup:

1. **Navigate to Backend Directory:**

3. **Set Up MongoDB:**

   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account or use an existing one.
   - Create a new cluster and database.
   - Obtain the connection string for your database.

4. **Environment Setup:**

   - In the backend folder, create a file named `.env`.
   - Inside the `.env` file, add the following line with your MongoDB connection string:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     ```

5. **Start Backend Server:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Additional Notes:

- Ensure that both frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously for the full functionality of the application.
- You may need to adjust CORS settings on your backend server to allow requests from your frontend domain.
- Make sure to replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` in the `.env` file with your actual MongoDB connection string.
- Check the respective documentation for any additional configuration or dependencies required for specific functionalities, such as PayPal integration.

With these instructions, users should be able to easily set up and run the project locally, along with configuring MongoDB for backend data storage.
